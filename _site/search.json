    "text": "I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Science, University of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, I am also affiliated with the University of Sydney (Australia), the Max Planck Institue of Psychiatry (Germany) and the National Institute of Biotechnology (Bangladesh).\nMy PhD project adopts a spatially resolved single-nucleus multimodal approach to delineate stress-induced molecular changes in the brains of psychiatric patients.\nIn addition to science, I love poetry, music, philosophy and paintings. I believe that the universe offers no inherent meaning for us, but we can face this absurdity of life by undertaking creative endeavors.\nSo, I started this blog to write about science, mostly neuroscience and computational biology, and to post my literary works. I just wanted to create a space where my thoughts can flow without any hindrance and thus help discover, improve and then rediscover myself.\nTo know more about me and my work, please consider visiting my website by clicking on the link that says Website on the top right corner of this page.\nThank you for visiting my blog! I really appreciate your support. If you like what I write, please recommend it to a friend. Should you have any feedback or comment, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via email or social media."

    "text": "At a vantage point,\nat the top of a mountain,\nthough our views are often blocked\nby clouds or mists,\nwe never stand alone.\n\n\nOn our shoulders,\nand on our neck,\nthe touch and the breath of those who are gone\nalways declare their presence\nalthough we sometimes fail to feel.\n\n\nAnd in this valley of choices and chances,\nthe past screams and the future waves,\nwe must both scream and wave back.\n\n\n\nContext\nThis poem highlights the necessity to acknowledge the coexistence of our past memories and our future prospects.\nWe tend to define our lives in terms of the choices we make and the opportunities we get. Although we are obsessed with the idea of constant progress and the contemplation of what the future might offer, we often ignore the efforts and sufferings of our ancestors. By failing to acknowledge the roles of our forefathers in shaping both our present and future, we lose an essential part of our identity. Our existential crisis majorly arises from this negligence.\nI once read somewhere that sustainable development is simply the act of making progress without reducing the future generations’ chances of survival. \nThus, sustainability and harmony can never be achieved until we choose to become a continuation of yesterday which will smoothly flow into the landscape of tomorrow."
