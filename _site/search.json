    "text": "I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Science, University of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, I am also affiliated with the University of Sydney (Australia), the Max Planck Institue of Psychiatry (Germany) and the National Institute of Biotechnology (Bangladesh).\nMy PhD project adopts a spatially resolved single-nucleus multimodal approach to delineate stress-induced molecular changes in the brains of psychiatric patients.\nIn addition to science, I love poetry, music, philosophy and paintings. I believe that the universe offers no inherent meaning for us, but we can face this absurdity of life by undertaking creative endeavors.\nSo, I started this blog to write about science, mostly neuroscience and computational biology, and to post my literary works. I just wanted to create a space where my thoughts can flow without any hindrance and thus help discover, improve and then rediscover myself.\nTo know more about me and my work, please consider visiting my website by clicking on the link that says Website on the top right corner of this page.\nThank you for visiting my blog! I really appreciate your support. If you like what I write, please recommend it to a friend. Should you have any feedback or comment, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via email or social media."
