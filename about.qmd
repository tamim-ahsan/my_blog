I am a **PhD Candidate** at the School of Science, **University of Wollongong**, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, I am also affiliated with the **University of Sydney** (Australia), the **Max Planck Institue of Psychiatry** (Germany) and the **National Institute of Biotechnology** (Bangladesh).

My PhD project adopts a **spatially resolved single-nucleus multimodal** approach to delineate **stress-induced molecular changes** in the **brains** of **psychiatric patients**.

In addition to science, I love **poetry**, **music**, **philosophy** and **paintings**. I believe that the universe offers *no inherent meaning* for us, but we can face this *absurdity of life* by undertaking creative endeavors.

So, I started this blog to write about science, mostly **neuroscience** and **computational biology**, and to post my **literary works**. I just wanted to create a space where my thoughts can flow without any hindrance and thus help discover, improve and then rediscover myself.

To know more about me and my work, please consider visiting my website by clicking on the link that says *Website* on the top right corner of this page.

Thank you for visiting my blog! I really appreciate your support. If you like what I write, **please recommend it to a friend**. Should you have any feedback or comment, please **do not hesitate to get in touch** with me via email or social media.
