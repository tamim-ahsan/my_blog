In the stillness of this cold night,

a half-eaten moon hangs from the sky.\
\

As I walk through the road

beset with long trees on both sides

and look up,

I glimpse a scantly lighted sky,

and patches of clouds are floating by.\
\

Far away,

there is an *inhuman* groan

that clings to darkness like a shadow

and dreams to devour us all.\
\

When I reach an open field though,

a flood of stars suddenly appears.\
\

For although my face is numb from coldness,

my eyes and whatever is left of *human* in me

still seek light,

even on this dark, lonely night.
