# Background

Single-cell omics approaches have revolutionized the field of molecular and cellular biology by endowing us with the ability to capture **cellular heterogeneity**. Although these approaches can help identify biological process-associated cell-states, as well as cell-type-specific molecular patterns, they involve a **cell dissociation** step which causes the loss of **spatial information**.\
\
Delineating the **spatial context** of a cell-state or cell-type is essential for fully dissecting its role in health and disease. Therefore, a series of spatial omics technologies are now being developed.\
\
In 2026, I expect my PhD project to make substantial use of **spatial transcriptomics** datasets to elucidate the cell-type- and region-specific molecular alterations associated with stress in the brains of **psychiatric patients**. Therefore, I will need to improve my understanding of the data generation and analysis methods.\
\
Undoubtedly, one of the best ways to deepen one's knowledge is to write about the topic of interest as much as one can. With that in mind, I have decided to regularly post about **spatial transcriptomic technologies** and **data analysis methods**. I am starting this journey with a poster briefly showing examples of **sequencing-based** spatial transcriptomic (sST) approaches that adopt various **spatial indexing** strategies. My future blog posts will explore data analysis workflows step by step.

# Poster on sequencing-based spatial transcriptomic technologies
As the original poster is quite large (~3100x4500 pixels), it had to be downsized. If you have trouble viewing its contents, I have left a link to it in the next section, using which you can view and/or download the poster in full resolution.
