At a vantage point,

at the top of a mountain,

though our views are often blocked

by clouds or mists,

we never stand alone.\
\

On our shoulders,

and on our neck,

the touch and the breath of those who are gone

always declare their presence

although we sometimes fail to feel.\
\

And in this valley of choices and chances,

the past screams and the future waves,

we must both scream and wave back.\
\

### **Context** 

This poem highlights the necessity to acknowledge the **coexistence of our past memories and our future prospects**.

We tend to define our lives in terms of the **choices** we make and the **opportunities** we get. Although we are obsessed with the idea of **constant progress** and the contemplation of what the future might offer, we often ignore the **efforts and sufferings of our ancestors.** By failing to acknowledge the roles of our forefathers in shaping both our present and future, we lose an **essential part of our identity**. Our **existential crisis** majorly arises from this negligence.

I once read somewhere that **sustainable development** is simply the act of making progress without reducing the future generations' chances of survival. 

Thus, **sustainability** and **harmony** can never be achieved until we choose to become a continuation of **yesterday** which will smoothly flow into the landscape of **tomorrow**.
